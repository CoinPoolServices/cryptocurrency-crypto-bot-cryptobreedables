**Why am I unable to execute all bot commands?**

There are two different areas for commands. In the #ðŸ¤–galilel-bot  all normal commands can be used. In the #game area only game commands can be executed. To get a list of commands use the command +help in each channel or read the pinned messages on the discord servers offering our game.

**How does the game work?**

Cryptobreedables is a text and image based driven game. Its as easy as it sounds. All actions can be done by reacting to the bot messages by clicking the emoji icons given on the events. You can fight, level up, collect some nice items and earn some free coins.
